# Cake thief
# Each type of cake has a weight and a value and is represented as a tuple
# (weight, value). You brought a duffel bag that can hold limited weight, and
# you want to make off with the most valuable haul possible.
#
# Write a function max_duffel_bag_value() that takes a list of cake type tuples
# and a weight capacity, and returns the maximum monetary value the duffel bag
# can hold.
#
# EXAMPLE
# Input:  [(7, 160), (3, 90), (2, 15)], 20
# Output: 555
# (6 of the middle type of cake and 1 of the last type of cake)
#
# Weights and values may be any non-negative integer.
#
# BONUS
# 1. We know the max value we can carry, but which cakes should we take, and
# how many? Try adjusting your answer to return this information as well.
#
# 2. What if we check to see if all the cake weights have a common denominator?
# Can we improve our algorithm?
#
# 3. A cake that's both heavier and worth less than another cake would never be
# in the optimal solution. This idea is called dominance relations. Can you
# apply this idea to save some time? Hint: dominance relations can apply to
# sets of cakes, not just individual cakes.
#
# 4. What if we had a tuple for every individual cake instead of types of
# cakes? So now there's not an unlimited supply of a type of cakeâ€”there's
# exactly one of each. This is a similar but harder problem, known as the
# 0/1 Knapsack problem.
