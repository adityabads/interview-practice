# Stock prices
# I have a list called stock_prices, where the indices are the time (in minutes)
# past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time. The values are the price
# (in US dollars) of one share of stock at that time.
#
# Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices and returns the best
# profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple
# stock yesterday.
#
# No "shorting" - you need to buy before you can sell. Also, you can't buy and
# sell in the same time stepâ€”at least 1 minute has to pass.
#
# EXAMPLE
# Input:  [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
# Output: 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
